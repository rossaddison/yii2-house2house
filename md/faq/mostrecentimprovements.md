A dashboard has been introduced by means of views/site/index.php which uses frontend/components/Utilities.php to provide the following functions:
    1. The last customer to signup.
    1. Cleans that are due for today.
    1. All streets that fall under the specific postcode. Each street has a schedule of houses with the relevant prices charged per house. 
       These schedules are viewable by means of dashboard Postcode Maps ie. type site/index in the browser and click on the Postcode Maps tab.
    1. A customer search.
    1. Postcode Finder using a popular finder.
